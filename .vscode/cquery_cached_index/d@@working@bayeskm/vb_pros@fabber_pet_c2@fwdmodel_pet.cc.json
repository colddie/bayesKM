This has a large variance so the model has a \nlot of freedom in fitting the parameters and will try to get as close to matching the data as it can. This is reflected in the high \nvariance we are using (1e6). For the mean values, a and b are multiplicative so it makes sense to give them defaults of 1 wherease c\n and d are additive so prior means of 0 seems more appropriate.\nThe second DistParams instance represents the initial posterior. This is the starting point for the optimisation as it tries to find\n the best values for each parameter. Usually this does not matter too much and can often be set to be identical to the prior.\nSometimes, however, it may be helpful to give the initial posterior a more restrictive (lower) variance to avoid numerical instability.\nIt is also possible to adjust the initial posterior on a per-voxel basis using the actual voxel data. We will not do that here, but it\n can be useful when fitting, for example, a constant offset, where we can tell the optimisation to start with a value that is the mean\n  of the data. This may help avoid instability and local minima.\nIn general it is against the spirit of the Bayesian approach to modify the priors on the basis of the data, and no means are provided to\n do this. It is possible for the user to modify the priors on a global basis but this is not encouraged and in general a model should try to provide good priors that will not need modification.","declarations":[],"spell":"166:19-166:40|0|2|2","extent":"166:1-182:2|-1|1|0","declaring_type":0,"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[11,12,13,14],"uses":[],"callees":["168:22-168:31|4|3|36","168:22-168:31|4|3|36"]},{"id":6,"usr":5275322567774856407,"detailed_name":"void PetFwdModel::Evaluate(const int &params, int &result) const","short_name_offset":18,"short_name_size":8,"kind":6,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"We now go back to our model code where we finally reach the point where we write the code to calculate our model:\nWe are given a list of parameter values (params) and need to produce a time series of predicted data values (result).\n We do this by looping over the parameters and adding the result of each exponential to the output result.\nThe additional argument key is not required in this case.
